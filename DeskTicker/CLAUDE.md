# DeskTicker — Claude Context

## Required Toolchain

**ESP32 Arduino core: 3.0.7** (Boards Manager → "esp32 by Espressif" → 3.0.7)

- Do **NOT** upgrade to 3.1.0 or later — introduces a display deadlock regression
  that hangs the tidepool/coral reef/starfield animations in ~40 min.
- Do **NOT** downgrade to 3.0.2 — HTTP client bug causes `YF: IncompleteInput`
  errors on Yahoo Finance responses.
- 3.0.7 is the bisect-tested sweet spot: hang window extends to 2–9 h (vs 30–45 min
  on 3.3.8), and HTTP works correctly.
- See `BISECT_LOG.md` for the full bisect history and test results.

## Project Overview

ESP32-S3 desk trading terminal. Fetches live OHLCV candle data from Yahoo Finance and renders
a candlestick chart on a 3.5" 480×320 IPS touchscreen. No cloud backend, no API key.

**Hardware:** JC3248W535C_I_Y board — ESP32-S3, AXS15231B QSPI display driver, capacitive touch.
**Framework:** Arduino + LVGL v8.3.9 + FreeRTOS.

## File Map

| File | Responsibility |
|------|---------------|
| `DeskTicker.ino` | Main state machine, WiFi/NTP lifecycle, loop orchestration |
| `assets.h` | `AssetDef` / `AssetData` / `Candle` structs; `ASSETS[]` table (24 assets); `asset_find()` |
| `settings.h / .cpp` | `Settings` struct; NVS load/save via Arduino `Preferences` |
| `api_client.h / .cpp` | Yahoo Finance v8 chart API fetch; 4H aggregation; host fallback |
| `chart_screen.h / .cpp` | LVGL chart screen: header, candle canvas, y-axis canvas, footer |
| `wifi_manager.h / .cpp` | AP captive-portal setup UI (LVGL screen + HTTP web form); asset picker grouped into Crypto / Stocks & ETFs / Commodities / Forex sections |
| `animations.h / .cpp` | After-hours fullscreen animations: tidepool, coral reef, starfield, countdown |
| `settings_screen.h / .cpp` | On-device settings menu: assets, TF, TZ, candle colour, anim, cycling, brightness, diagnostics |
| `tz_options.h / .cpp` | Shared 34-entry timezone table consumed by both `wifi_manager` and `settings_screen` |

Board support files (`esp_bsp`, `lv_port`, `esp_lcd_*`, `display.h`, `lv_conf.h`) were
originally copied from the JC3248W535EN demo. `lv_port.c`, `lv_port.h`, `esp_bsp.c`, and
`esp_bsp.h` have been edited for the display-deadlock investigation (see below). The others
(`esp_lcd_*`, `display.h`, `lv_conf.h`) remain unmodified.

**PERMANENT INCOMPATIBILITY — `full_refresh` must stay `1` in `lv_port.c`.**
`full_refresh = 0` (partial refresh) was tested and immediately caused severe garbled display
output: diagonal colour stripes on the settings page and double/overlapping frames on the chart.
Root cause: the flush callback performs a software 90° coordinate rotation that was written for
full-screen writes only. Partial-area `(x1,y1)→(x2,y2)` coordinates are mis-mapped through
the rotation, landing in the wrong physical display region. Do not attempt partial refresh again
without first rewriting the flush callback's rotation to handle sub-screen areas.

**Semaphore waits — currently bounded (see investigation below).** Both
`trans_done_sem` in `lv_port.c` and `te_v_sync_sem` in `esp_bsp.c` are bounded to 100 ms
(`LVGL_PORT_FLUSH_TIMEOUT_MS` / `BSP_TE_SYNC_TIMEOUT_MS`). This replaced the original
`portMAX_DELAY`. However, first soak data shows `flushTO=0 teTO=0` at the freeze — meaning
the bounded waits are NOT on the critical path during the chart hang. Investigation continues
(render-phase locator added; see BISECT_LOG.md 2026-05-31 entry).

## State Machine (`DeskTicker.ino`)

```
S_INIT → S_WIFI_SETUP (first boot, no saved WiFi)
       → S_CONNECTING (saved WiFi exists)

S_CONNECTING → S_NTP_SYNC (connected)
             → S_WIFI_SETUP (retries exhausted, no cached data)
             → S_CHART / S_AFTER_HOURS (retries exhausted, has cached data)

S_NTP_SYNC → S_FETCH

S_FETCH → S_CHART (market open)
        → S_AFTER_HOURS (market closed)
        → S_RECONNECT (HTTP -1: TCP failure on both YF hosts)

S_CHART → S_FETCH (refresh interval, swipe, auto-cycle, market close)
        → S_RECONNECT (WiFi lost)
        → S_SETTINGS (triple-tap)

S_AFTER_HOURS → S_FETCH (re-check every 5 min, swipe, auto-cycle)
              → S_RECONNECT (WiFi lost)
              → S_SETTINGS (triple-tap)

S_SETTINGS → S_FETCH (cancel — chart_displaced flag restores the chart)
           → reboot (save)

S_RECONNECT → S_FETCH (soft reconnect succeeded, chart was visible — chart stays on screen)
            → S_NTP_SYNC (soft reconnect succeeded but NTP was never done)
            → S_CONNECTING (soft window exhausted, or no chart visible — full screen)
```

`S_RECONNECT` tries up to `RECONNECT_SOFT_TRIES` × `RECONNECT_SOFT_MS` silent
reconnects while the chart stays on screen ("Reconnecting…" in header). Only
falls back to the full `S_CONNECTING` screen if the network stays down for the
whole soft window, or if no chart is currently visible (e.g. first-boot,
after-hours).

## Critical Patterns

### LVGL Lock
Every LVGL call must be made while holding the display mutex:
```cpp
if (LV_LOCK()) {
    // LVGL calls here
    LV_UNLOCK();
}
```
`LV_LOCK()` = `bsp_display_lock(2000)`, `LV_UNLOCK()` = `bsp_display_unlock()`.
The timeout is **2000 ms, not 0**. `bsp_display_lock(0)` maps to `portMAX_DELAY` (infinite wait). The vendor flush callback (`bsp_display_sync_cb`) holds `lvgl_mux` while waiting for the panel's tearing-effect interrupt with `portMAX_DELAY`; if a TE interrupt is missed, the LVGL task is stuck forever holding the mutex and an infinite-wait `LV_LOCK()` in the main loop never returns → total freeze requiring power cycle. A 2 s timeout lets the main loop skip the update and retry, converting a permanent freeze into a brief self-healing stall.
Forgetting the lock causes silent corruption or crashes.

### Screen Lifecycle (pending_del_scr)
LVGL crashes if you `lv_obj_del()` the currently active screen.
The pattern used here:
1. `queue_scr_for_delete(old_scr)` — stores the screen to be deleted
2. Load the new screen with `lv_scr_load()`
3. `cleanup_pending_scr()` — now safely deletes the queued screen

Always call `cleanup_pending_scr()` immediately after `lv_scr_load()` / `chart_screen_show()` / `anim_start()`.

**Critical for chart → after-hours transitions:** `chart_screen_destroy()` must be called **after** `anim_start()` loads the animation screen, not before. When swiping from a crypto asset (which always shows a chart) to a closed-market commodity, the chart is the active screen; destroying it first leaves `act_scr` dangling and `anim_start`'s own `lv_scr_load` dereferences it → `LoadProhibited` crash. The fix: compare `lv_scr_act()` before and after `anim_start()`, then destroy the chart only if the active screen changed.

### Background Refresh (bg_refresh flag)
When `chart_created == true`, the chart is already visible. Avoid displacing it with a loading screen:
```cpp
bool bg_refresh = chart_created;
if (!bg_refresh) show_connecting("Fetching...");
else { /* one locked set_status("Fetching…") — see below */ }
// ... fetch ...
hide_connecting();
// on success, inside the final chart_screen_update() lock:
//   chart_screen_set_status("");  chart_screen_update(...);
```
On fetch failure during bg_refresh, write the error to `chart_screen_set_status()` (NOT `show_error()`) — `show_error()` creates a persistent label on `chart_scr` with no cleanup path.

**Exactly ONE locked `chart_screen_set_status` write before the fetch; the clear is folded into the final `chart_screen_update()` lock (not a separate lock block).** Each standalone locked label write is a separate LVGL flush. The original code had `set_status("Fetching…")` + `set_status("")` as two separate lock blocks → two extra flushes on top of the gesture flush and the full-redraw flush → 4 back-to-back flushes maximized the probability of hitting the vendor TE-sync race in `bsp_display_sync_cb` / `bsp_display_sync_task` → device freeze. Rule: one set (before fetch), zero-cost clear (inside the redraw lock).

### Gesture Flags
Swipe flags are `volatile int8_t` set by the LVGL task and read+cleared by the main loop.
Read with the dedicated accessors (they reset the flag atomically):
```cpp
int chart_screen_get_swipe();       // ±1 horizontal (assets)
int chart_screen_get_swipe_vert();  // ±1 vertical (timeframes)
int anim_get_swipe();               // ±1 horizontal (assets, after-hours screen)
```
Swipe directions (with LV_DISP_ROT_90): LEFT=+1 (next asset), RIGHT=-1 (prev asset),
TOP=+1 (next timeframe), BOTTOM=-1 (prev timeframe).

### PSRAM Canvas Buffers
Both chart canvases are allocated in OPI PSRAM with `heap_caps_malloc(..., MALLOC_CAP_SPIRAM)`.
Free them in `chart_screen_destroy()` before the parent object is deleted.
Current sizes:
- `chart_buf`: `CANVAS_W × CANVAS_H × 2` bytes ≈ 150 KB
- `yaxis_buf`: `YAXIS_W × CHART_H × 2` bytes ≈ 35 KB
- `anim_buf` (animations): `SCR_W × SCR_H × 2` bytes ≈ 300 KB

## Layout Constants (`chart_screen.h`)

| Constant | Value | Meaning |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `SCR_W / SCR_H` | 480 / 320 | Logical screen size after 90° rotation |
| `HDR_H / FTR_H` | 48 / 48 | Header and footer height |
| `CHART_H` | 224 | Chart area height (SCR_H − HDR_H − FTR_H) |
| `LEFT_MARGIN` | 8 | Chart canvas left offset (matches header 8px left inset) |
| `RIGHT_MARGIN` | 8 | Gap between y-axis canvas right edge and screen edge |
| `YAXIS_W` | 80 | Y-axis canvas width (must fit 9-digit prices at font_14) |
| `CANVAS_W` | 384 | Chart canvas width (SCR_W − YAXIS_W − LEFT_MARGIN − RIGHT_MARGIN) |
| `CANVAS_H` | 196 | Chart canvas height (CHART_H − 28 px for x-axis labels) |
| `XAXIS_H` | 28 | X-axis label strip below candle canvas (CHART_H − CANVAS_H) |
| `CHART_BOX_MARGIN` | 6 | Vertical gap between header/footer and the chart box border |
| `CANDLE_W / CANDLE_G` | 7 / 2 | Candle body width and gap |
| `CANDLE_STEP` | 9 | Pixels per candle slot |
| `CHART_RIGHT_PAD` | 4 | Empty candle slots right of newest candle |
| `MAX_VIS_CANDLES` | ~38 | Visible candles = CANVAS_W/CANDLE_STEP − CHART_RIGHT_PAD |

Y-axis canvas sits at `x = LEFT_MARGIN + CANVAS_W = 392`, width 80, right edge at 472.
The rightmost 8px (472–480) is bare `COL_BG` background (right margin).

---

## Header Layout

Flex row (left-aligned, vertically centered) inside `hdr`:
- `lbl_ticker` (font_22, `pad_right=6`) → 1×18px vertical separator bar → `lbl_price` (font_22, `pad_left=6`) → `lbl_change` (font_16, `pad_left=6`)
- `lbl_status` (font_10, right-anchored at −65px) — shows "Fetching …" or error during bg refresh
- `lbl_tf` (font_16, right-anchored at −8px) — active timeframe label

Footer: `lbl_ohlc` + `lbl_vol` (left, font_12) | `dot_wifi` 10×10 circle (right, −8px).

---

## Y-Axis Drawing

Drawn entirely with `lv_canvas_draw_*` (not LVGL widgets):
- **Grid labels** (font_14, `LV_TEXT_ALIGN_LEFT`, x=LABEL_PAD=4): 4 evenly spaced price levels
- **Current price pill** (blue rect `COL_CUR_PX`, height 17px): width = `text_width + PILL_PAD(16px)`, right-aligned to yaxis canvas right edge; font_12 text is explicitly centered inside the pill

Grid labels use `lv_txt_get_size` to measure the text pixel width, then draw at `x = YAXIS_W - text_width` with `max_w = text_width + 1`. This right-aligns every label flush with the yaxis canvas right edge (= screen right edge minus RIGHT_MARGIN), matching the blue current-price pill. The gap between the chart gridline and the first digit adjusts automatically: short prices (e.g. "9.42") get a wider gap, long prices (e.g. "78959.74") get a narrower gap. Using a bounding box exactly as wide as the text also defeats the LVGL canvas centering quirk that caused inconsistent alignment in earlier versions.

If YAXIS_W is reduced, verify that a 9-digit price ("103245.12") still fits at font_14 (~74px).

---

## API Client (`api_client.cpp`)

- **Endpoint:** `https://query1.finance.yahoo.com/v8/finance/chart/{ticker}?interval=…&period1=…&period2=…`
- **Fallback host:** `query2.finance.yahoo.com` — tried on any YF error string
- **HTTP -1** (TCP failure on both hosts) triggers `S_RECONNECT` in the main loop
- **Streaming avoided:** `http.useHTTP10(true)` + `http.getString()` reads the full body before parsing
- **JSON filter:** `StaticJsonDocument<512>` filter + `PsramJsonDocument(49152)` — genuinely allocated in PSRAM via `SpiRamAllocator` (see top of `api_client.cpp`); the small anchor doc uses `PsramJsonDocument(8192)`
- **4H timeframe:** fetched as 1H bars, aggregated 4:1 on-device in `yf_try_host()`; the partial (still-forming) 4H group at the tail **is emitted** (not discarded) so `today_open_utc()` can find the 00:00-UTC bucket open price
- **Candle cap:** non-4H path uses `int start = (raw > MAX_CANDLES) ? raw - MAX_CANDLES : 0` to prevent buffer overflow
- **Fetch window (`yf_period1`):** signature is `yf_period1(tf, market, continuous)`. Assets where `market == MARKET_CRYPTO` **or** `continuous == 1` use the small 24/7-sized window (e.g. 4H = 12 cal days of 1h bars ≈ 288 bars). All other assets use the stock window (4H = 55 cal days ≈ 240 1h bars). **Root cause of the GOLD/OIL/SILVER reset crash:** those 24/7 crypto-style tokens classified as `MARKET_COMMODITY` previously fell into the stock window, pulling ~1300 hourly bars → ~150-250 KB JSON → ESP32 heap exhaustion → panic/reset. Fixed by setting `continuous = 1` on those entries in `ASSETS[]`.

Refresh intervals: 15m=30s, 1H=30s, 4H=30s, 1D=600s.

## Settings (`settings.h / .cpp`)

Stored in NVS namespace `"lilfish"` via `Preferences`. **Do not rename this namespace** — changing it would silently wipe all saved user settings (WiFi credentials, assets, theme, etc.) on the next flash. The name is intentionally kept from the original firmware even after the DeskTicker brand rename. Key names:

| Key | Type | Meaning |
|-----|------|---------|
| `init` | bool | True once settings have been saved at least once |
| `ssid` / `pass` | string | WiFi credentials |
| `wifi_ok` | bool | True after first successful save |
| `n_assets` | int | Asset count (1–6) |
| `a0`…`a5` | string | Asset symbols |
| `tf` | int | Active timeframe (TF_* value) |
| `tf_n` | int | Number of enabled timeframes |
| `tf0`…`tf3` | int | Enabled timeframe values |
| `theme` | int | THEME_* |
| `bull` / `bear` | uint | 0xRRGGBB candle colors |
| `cycle` | int | Auto-cycle seconds (0 = manual) |
| `anim` | int | ANIM_* |
| `tz` | int | UTC offset in minutes (e.g. −300 = UTC−5) |

On load, if `tf_n` is missing (old firmware), the single saved `tf` is wrapped into `timeframes[0]` for backward compatibility.

---

## Timezone

`cfg.tz_offset` is UTC offset in minutes. Converted to a POSIX TZ string by `make_tz_string()`:
- POSIX sign is opposite to human convention: UTC+5:30 → offset=+330 → `"UTC-5:30"`
- Applied with `configTzTime(tz_buf, NTP_SERVER)` during `S_NTP_SYNC`
- No DST — user sets their current local offset manually
- `tz_offset` is **display-only** — it never affects market-hours detection (see below).

---

## Market-Hours Detection (`is_after_hours()`)

Decides live chart vs after-hours animation **per asset class**. Never uses
`tz_offset` — each session is anchored to its own exchange.

**Yahoo dropped `meta.marketState` from the chart API** (verified: absent for all
tickers, so `meta["marketState"] | "CLOSED"` always reads CLOSED — do NOT rely on it).
Detection now uses two surviving `meta` fields, parsed into `AssetData`:
- `currentTradingPeriod.regular.{start,end}` → `reg_start`/`reg_end` (epoch s): precise,
  per-exchange, calendar-aware session window. Used for stocks/ETFs **and any foreign
  ticker** (auto-adapts to NYSE/Bursa/LSE/TSE; holidays handled). Coarse/unusable for
  FX & futures.
- `regularMarketTime` → `reg_mkt_time` (last-trade epoch s): fresh during a live
  session, ≥1 day stale on a holiday. `last_trade_stale()` flags stale > `HOLIDAY_STALE_SECS`
  (2 h) to detect bank holidays for FX/futures.

Rules: Crypto/Commodity always live · Forex = local session Sun 17:00→Fri 17:00 ET
(`fx_session_open`) or stale-trade · Futures = local Globex Sun 18:00→Fri 17:00 ET
minus 17:00–18:00 ET halt (`futures_session_open`) or stale-trade · Stocks/foreign =
`reg_start ≤ now < reg_end`, failsafe NYSE 09:30–16:00 ET when window absent/no data.
`secs_to_market_open(idx)` returns the per-class next-open for the countdown animation.

---

## BOOT Button Reset

GPIO 0 (labeled **BOOT** on the board, NOT RST). Held LOW for ≥ 3 seconds in `loop()` calls
`settings_clear()` + `ESP.restart()` → returns to `S_WIFI_SETUP`.

---

## After-Hours Animations

Four scenes: **Tidepool** (rocky shore, dusk sky, pixel crab walk), **Coral Reef** (underwater
parallax, tropical fish, pixel crab), **Starfield** (slow star drift), **Countdown** (digital
clock to the asset's next session open via `secs_to_market_open(idx)` — NYSE 09:30 ET for
stocks, Sun 17:00 ET for forex, Sun/18:00 ET for futures; crab walk, digit color shifts
Pearl→Amber→Green in final 30/5 min).

All scenes share `anim_scr` + `anim_canvas` (PSRAM) driven by `lv_timer_create()` at 120 ms.
Countdown (`ANIM_COUNTDOWN`) additionally uses `cd_crab_canvas` (480×50 PSRAM strip) + a
separate `cd_crab_timer` at 120 ms for the crab walk layer.
`anim_stop()` deletes all timers first, then the screen(s) / frees PSRAM buffers.

Crab claw colors follow `s_anim_bull` / `s_anim_bear` globals (set via `anim_set_candle_colors()`
before `anim_start()`). The main loop calls `anim_set_candle_colors(cfg.bull_rgb, cfg.bear_rgb)`
each time it enters `S_AFTER_HOURS`.

**After-hours poll interval:** `S_AFTER_HOURS` re-checks market hours every **5 minutes**
(`300000UL` ms). Each re-check calls `anim_stop()` → `S_FETCH` → `anim_start()`, so the
animation screen itself is rebuilt every ~5 minutes.

**Render watchdog (always-on):** a 30-second `esp_timer` reboots the device if the LVGL
render task stops producing frames — the silent QSPI / tearing-effect display deadlock (see
`BISECT_LOG.md`). It is armed once by `render_wdt_init()` in `setup()` (after
`bsp_display_start()`, under `LV_LOCK`) and fed by a global render-task `lv_timer`
(`render_feed_cb`, 1 s), so it now covers **every** screen including the live chart (was
after-hours only before 2026-05-30). `anim_start`/`anim_stop` no longer touch it; never call
`wdt_stop()` (removed — the watchdog must stay armed). On the next boot,
`render_wdt_consume_last_reboot()` logs `[WDT] previous boot ended in a render-watchdog
reboot…`; a `[health]` line every 60 s logs heap/PSRAM/heartbeat. Being always-on, it also
retires the old "watchdog never runs >5 min" soak-test caveat.

**Display-flush deadlock — ROOT CAUSE FIXED (2026-05-31, final commit `b03bc1c`;
soak-confirmed PASS 2026-06-06, branch merged to `main`):**
Root cause: `api_fetch()` was called with LVGL rendering running freely (no mutex,
no pause). While WiFi received the 21 KB JSON response (~50–200 ms of DMA), the LVGL
render task ran full_refresh flushes at ~50–66 Hz via QSPI DMA. Both share the internal
AHB bus. When they overlapped, the QSPI DMA completion interrupt was lost → render task
hung inside `panel_axs15231b_draw_bitmap()` (confirmed by `phase=4`/`phase=7` in freeze
logs).

**Fix — the `lvgl_flush_suspended` flag** (`lv_port.c`): the flush callback checks this
flag at its very top; when true it calls `lv_disp_flush_ready(drv)` and returns WITHOUT
starting any QSPI DMA, so there is no WiFi/QSPI DMA overlap. `DeskTicker.ino` sets
`lvgl_flush_suspended = true` immediately before the single `api_fetch()` call in `S_FETCH`
and `= false` right after. The display shows the previous frame for ~0.5–2 s per fetch
(unnoticeable at the 30 s refresh interval).

This is the ONE fetch path shared by BOTH the live chart and the after-hours animation —
they both reach fetching by transitioning into `S_FETCH` — so the after-hours animation is
covered automatically by the same suspend window. There is no per-screen change to make.

Crucially, unlike `lv_timer_handler()`, `lvgl_flush_suspended` leaves the LVGL timer system
RUNNING, so the render-watchdog feed timer keeps firing every 1 s → no false watchdog
reboots on slow or retried fetches. (An earlier approach — `lvgl_port_stop()`/`resume()`
around the fetch, commit `6e18368` — was REVERTED in `b03bc1c` precisely because
`lvgl_port_stop()` calls `lv_timer_enable(false)`, which starved the watchdog feed and
caused false reboots. Do NOT reintroduce `lvgl_port_stop()` for this.)

Because the display is frozen during the fetch, the "Fetching…" status must be painted
SYNCHRONOUSLY before the flag is set: the chart path calls `lv_refr_now(NULL)` after
`chart_screen_set_status()` (commit `1b11eb4`), and `show_connecting()` does the same for
the after-hours→fetch path (commit `da01565`). A plain set-label-then-unlock does not work
because the async render task may never paint before the freeze.

Remaining backstops (still in place):
- **5s watchdog** — reboots and resumes last-viewed asset/TF if anything else hangs
- **Bounded waits** `flushTO`/`teTO`/`lockTO` — cover other stuck paths
- **Phase locator** `phase=`/`chunk=` in `[WDT] previous boot` and `[health]`
- Phase decode: 0=idle, 2=TE wait, 3=DMA-done wait, 4=tx_color DMA, 5=done,
  6=mutex wait, 7=tx_param CASET cmd

LVGL upgrade would NOT have fixed this (bug is in precompiled SPI driver, below LVGL).
Core stays **3.0.7**; `full_refresh` stays 1. See `BISECT_LOG.md` 2026-05-31 entries.

## On-Device Settings Menu

### Triple-Tap Trigger

The AXS15231B touch IC pulses its INT line only on touch *transitions* (down / up), never
continuously while a finger rests. This means stationary holds produce exactly one PRESSED
and one RELEASED event — LVGL never sees repeated `LV_EVENT_PRESSING` ticks, so a hold
timer cannot work. **Two-finger hold is also impossible** — the driver is single-touch only.

Fix: **triple-tap** (3 taps within 1.2 s). Each discrete tap fires a clean down+up interrupt
pair, registering reliably. A swipe emits `LV_EVENT_GESTURE` (never `LV_EVENT_CLICKED`),
so swipes can never be mistaken for taps. State tracked in `chart_tap_count` /
`chart_last_tap_ms` (chart screen) and `anim_tap_count` / `anim_last_tap_ms` (anim screens).

### Click Routing on the Chart Screen

`LV_EVENT_CLICKED` is delivered only to the object the press lands on (`act_obj`) — it does
**not** bubble. The chart screen is fully covered by container objects (`hdr`, `left_cont`,
`lbl_dot`, `chart_cont`, `ftr`, `dot_wifi`), which would swallow every tap. Fix: clear
`LV_OBJ_FLAG_CLICKABLE` on all six containers so hit-testing falls through to `chart_scr`
where `chart_tap_cb` is registered. Gesture bubbling (`LV_OBJ_FLAG_GESTURE_BUBBLE`) is on by
default and is unaffected — swipes still reach `chart_scr`.

### S_SETTINGS State

- **Entry:** copy `Settings work = cfg;` then call `settings_screen_create(&work)` under
  `LV_LOCK()`; use `cleanup_pending_scr()` to delete the prior screen.
- **Poll loop:** call `settings_screen_poll()` each iteration →
  `0` = still editing / `1` = save / `-1` = cancel.
- **Save (1):** `settings_screen_get(&out); settings_save(&out);` display a brief reboot
  warning, then `ESP.restart()`.
- **Cancel (-1):** destroy the settings screen, set `last_fetch_ms = 0`,
  `state = S_FETCH`. The existing `chart_displaced` path at the top of `S_FETCH` rebuilds
  the chart without a loading screen if it was previously visible.

### Settings Screen API (`settings_screen.h`)

```cpp
void settings_screen_create(const Settings* work); // builds UI + lv_scr_load; under LV_LOCK
int  settings_screen_poll();                        // 0 = editing / 1 = save / -1 = cancel
void settings_screen_get(Settings* out);            // copy edited working copy out
void settings_screen_destroy();                     // teardown + queue delete; under LV_LOCK
```

### Candle Colour Page

The theme picker uses **4 custom selectable rows** (not `lv_roller`) so each row can display
up/down candle color swatches. ColorShift and NeonPulse are animated at runtime but the
swatches show a fixed representative sample. The `theme_roller` static pointer was removed;
`ss_work.theme` is written immediately in the tap callback, not on save. Arrays:
`theme_rows[4]` and `theme_checks[4]` (checkmark labels, hidden/shown on selection).

---

## Common Gotchas

- **Never call `lv_obj_del()` on `lv_scr_act()`** — always use `queue_scr_for_delete` + `cleanup_pending_scr`.
- **`show_error()` creates an unmanaged label** on the active screen. Only safe to use when `bg_refresh == false` (i.e., conn_scr is active and will be deleted shortly). When `bg_refresh == true`, use `chart_screen_set_status()` instead.
- **`lv_font_montserrat_N`** must be enabled in `lv_conf.h`. Currently enabled: 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 40, 48.
- **Text alignment in canvas**: set `dsc.align` before calling `lv_canvas_draw_text()`. For left-aligned text, start x at 4 for a consistent left margin; width is the bounding box.
- **4H aggregation** emits the partial (still-forming) tail group — this is intentional so the 00:00-UTC bucket open is always present for `today_open_utc()` to anchor the % change correctly.
- **`continuous = 1` is required for any 24/7 asset** (crypto-style tokens, CME futures, anything that trades outside stock-market hours). Omitting it causes the 4H fetch window to request ~1300 hourly bars → huge JSON → ESP32 heap exhaustion → reset.
- **ArduinoJson documents must use `PsramJsonDocument`, not `DynamicJsonDocument`**. `DynamicJsonDocument` allocates from the internal heap (only ~200 KB), which mbedTLS / WiFiClientSecure fragmentation can exhaust, causing a directional reset (e.g. crypto-then-commodity swipe on 1D). `PsramJsonDocument` uses the 8 MB PSRAM and is immune to this.
- **`CANVAS_X` define is unused** — canvas position is set explicitly with `lv_obj_set_pos`.
